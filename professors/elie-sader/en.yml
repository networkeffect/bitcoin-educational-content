  With over 20 years of deploying low latency mission critical networks, I have experienced first hand the deployment of new technologies and the superiority of open standard protocols with their network effets. I understand the challenges of building new products, new business models and solutions as well as evangelizing the market and customers. Part time buisness angel I help companies bring innovative tech on the market. I have launched Network Effect in order to help companies understand the value that Bitcoin can bring them, as well as spell out practical use cases for all kinds of core businesses. The Bitcoin network is a supercharged value exchange rail and layer 2 protocols such as Lightning will profoundly disrupt not only intermediaries and fee structures, but also usher in an era of new business models more powerful and more respectful of individualâ€™s privacy.
