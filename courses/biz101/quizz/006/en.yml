question: Why is the 21 million cap on Bitcoin issuance significant?
  answer: It creates a deflationary asset, protecting its value against arbitrary inflation.
  wrong_answers:
    - It ensures that governments can print as many bitcoins as needed.
    - It prevents anyone from sending transactions after the cap is reached.
    - It eliminates all volatility in Bitcoin’s price.
  explanation: |
    By having a maximum supply of 21 million, Bitcoin’s scarcity is hard-coded, making it fundamentally different from inflationary currencies where supply can be increased at will.
