question: What is generally recommended when allocating a portion of a company’s treasury to Bitcoin?
  answer: Invest only excess liquidity that you won’t need for several years and maintain a time horizon of at least four years.
  wrong_answers:
    - Use all operational cash immediately without considering liquidity needs.
    - Aim to buy and sell within a few weeks to maximize short-term profits.
    - Only invest when you need an urgent short-term loan to cover expenses.
  explanation: |
    Because Bitcoin’s price can be volatile in the short term, it’s wise to use funds you don’t need right away and hold for at least four years. This approach smooths out volatility and increases the chances of realizing long-term value appreciation.
