question: What is “hidden inflation” in the context of a debt-based monetary system?
  answer: It’s the increase in the money supply (around 7% per year) that reduces your share of overall value if you don’t invest or grow assets accordingly.
  wrong_answers:
    - It’s an official economic term for fixed interest rates.
    - It refers to inflation numbers not published by central banks.
    - It means prices never rise, even when money supply expands.
  explanation: |
    Hidden inflation occurs when the money supply expands, diminishing the purchasing power of savings. If a business doesn't proactively invest or protect its wealth, it risks losing value to this quiet form of monetary dilution.
