question: How does the Lightning Network help reduce fees for Bitcoin transactions?
  answer: By conducting most transactions off-chain and publishing only channel settlement transactions on the main blockchain.
  wrong_answers:
    - By removing all cryptographic verification from payments.
    - By centralizing control in one large payment hub.
    - By requiring merchants to pay all network costs upfront.
  explanation: |
    Since Lightning transactions happen off-chain, only the final channel states are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain. This reduces congestion and thus lowers fees by avoiding making many on-chain transactions.
