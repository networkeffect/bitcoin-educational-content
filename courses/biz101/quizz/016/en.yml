question: How does artificially created capital from debt-based money differ from Austrian-style capital?
  answer: Austrian-style capital stems from real savings and sacrifice, while debt-based capital is created instantly from credit and can distort economic signals.
  wrong_answers:
    - Austrian-style capital is generated by printing more money whenever needed.
    - Debt-based capital never requires repayment and is equivalent to real savings.
    - There is no difference; both forms of capital are identical in nature and effect.
  explanation: |
    Austrian capital emerges from actual foregone consumption and careful investment. Debt-based capital, created easily through loans, can mislead entrepreneurs and lead to inefficient investments, as it doesnâ€™t reflect true savings or consumer preferences.
