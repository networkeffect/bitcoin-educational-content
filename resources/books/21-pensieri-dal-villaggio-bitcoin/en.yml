  Intransigent analyses of economic and social dynamics, biting criticisms of the current monetary system, irreverent political and philosophical considerations, futuristic predictions, discoveries and conclusions that are often counterintuitive, but always seasoned with an unfailing dash of irony;
  21 Thoughts from the Bitcoin Village is the result of endless reflections and sleepless nights of those who, for years, have been trying to find their way restlessly inside the rabbit hole of Bitcoin.
