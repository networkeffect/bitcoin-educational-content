  Erik Cason’s masterwork brilliantly unpacks the philosophical ideals and
  intersections of Bitcoin, sovereignty, and cryptography in the 21st century. The
  result is about more than just money. It’s about the real personal power created
  through the sovereignty of cryptography and a truly independent monetary system.

  Erik Cason first started dabbling in Bitcoin in 2012, and in 2013 he joined Coinbase to help get Bitcoin in the hands of as many people as possible. After leaving Coinbase in 2017, he focused on writing essays on the social, political, and philosophical aspects of Bitcoin. Today he works as a Bitcoin educator continuing to develop his philosophical approach to Bitcoin and how it will transform the world.
