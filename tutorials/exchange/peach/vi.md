## Introduction

KYC-free peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges are essential for preserving users' confidentiality and financial autonomy. They enable direct transactions between individuals without the need for identity verification, which is crucial for those who value privacy. For a more in-depth understanding of the theoretical concepts, take a look at the BTC204 course:

### 1. What is Peach?

Peach is a P2P exchange platform that allows users to buy and sell bitcoins without KYC. It offers an intuitive interface and advanced security features. Compared to other solutions such as Bisq, HodlHodl, and Robosat, Peach stands out for its ease of use and low fees.

### 2. Privacy and Data Collection

**What information does Peach collect?

Peach strives to store the absolute minimum of data about its users. Here is an overview of the data stored on its servers:


- A hash of your unique application identifier (AdID)
- A hash of your payment data
- Your encrypted conversations
- Transaction data to ensure that anonymous users do not exceed the trading limit (types of payment methods used, purchase and sale amounts)
- Addresses used to send and receive from the escrow account
- Usage data (Firebase & Google Analytics), only with your consent

As a reminder, a hash is data rendered unrecognizable, similar to encryption. The same data will always produce the same hash, making it possible to detect duplicates without knowing the original data.

*For more information on hashing, you can follow this course:*

**Who can see my payment details?


- Only your counterparty can see your payment details
- Data is transmitted via Peach servers but is fully encrypted from end to end
- In the event of a dispute, your payment details and conversation history will be visible to the assigned Peach mediator

### 4. How to secure your portfolio

**Understanding your Peach account

A Peach account is not a traditional login and password account. It's a file stored locally on your phone, which means Peach doesn't need to store your data or know your identity: you're in control. This file contains all your data, from your bitcoin wallet keys to your payment details.

This approach guarantees greater confidentiality, but also implies greater responsibility. Losing your phone without a backup means losing access to your Peach account and funds. So it's crucial to back up this file and protect it with a strong password.

**Create your backups**

![Accéder aux sauvegardes](assets/fr/13.webp)


- Access settings from the tab at the bottom right of the home screen
- Select the "backups" option in the settings menu

![Processus de sauvegarde](assets/fr/06.webp)

Two types of backup are available:

**Save account file (image 14)**


- Click on "Create new backup"
- Create a strong password to encrypt your backup file
- Keep this file in a safe place

The file backup restores your complete Peach account, including :


- Your portfolio
- Your payment methods
- Conversation history
- Payment data
- Transaction history with counterparty details

**Saving the recovery phrase (image 15)**


- Follow the instructions to display your recovery phrase
- Carefully write down the words in the correct order
- Store this backup in a secure location, ideally different from the account file

The recovery phrase only recovers :


- Access to your account
- Your bitcoin funds

You will lose :


- Conversation history
- Payment data
- Counterparty information in transaction history

For optimum security, we recommend that you perform both types of backup.
