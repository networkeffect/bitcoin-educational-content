Founded in 2012, Bitfinex is one of the first bitcoin and altcoin exchange platforms. Initially focused on P2P bitcoin exchanges, the platform quickly expanded its services to include margin trading, P2P financing, derivatives trading, and an OTC ("*over-the-counter*") market for high-volume transactions.

Today, Bitfinex is a complete platform, allowing both simple purchases of bitcoins and the use of advanced trading features with risk management tools. It is available in a web version, and for simple transactions, an easy-to-use mobile application is also available.

Bitfinex actively supports the development of Bitcoin, investing in technologies such as the Lightning Network and promoting peer-to-peer solutions for financial freedom.

## How can I buy bitcoin on Bitfinex?

To buy bitcoin on Bitfinex, start by [creating an account on the platform](https://www.bitfinex.com/sign-up/). Make sure you use a strong and unique password, i.e. as random as possible, with a wide variety of characters and of sufficient length.

To secure your passwords and guarantee the use of strong passwords for your online accounts, especially on Bitfinex, I strongly advise you to use a password manager. Check out our tutorial on Bitwarden to learn how to install and use it on a daily basis:

You can then make a deposit with the payment method of your choice and purchase bitcoin.

You can also set up a recurring purchase of bitcoins to smooth your acquisition price over time (*DCA*).

After purchasing your first bitcoins, you have the option of leaving them on the platform, but I strongly recommend transferring them to your own self-custody wallet. If you don't yet know how to use a Bitcoin wallet, I invite you to explore [the "Wallet" section on PlanB Network](https://planb.network/tutorials/wallet).

## How do I secure my Bitfinex account?

Once you've created your account, I recommend that you secure it by adding a second authentication factor (2FA), either with a physical key or via an authentication application.

If you don't know how to use these dual authentication solutions to secure your online accounts, I recommend you take a look at our tutorial on the Authy application:

Or, if you prefer to use a physical key, see our tutorial on Yubikey :

## How to use the trading functions

Finally, if you want to use the more advanced trading features on Bitfinex, you can set up your own Trade Desk templates:

You can also create sub-accounts to segregate different uses of Bitfinex.
